Project Overview

This is a Password Generator project written in C. The purpose of this project is to help me get started with C programming while creating a useful tool that generates secure random passwords. The program allows users to customize the length of the password and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.

Include or exclude character types such as:
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special symbols (!, @, #, etc.)

Technologies Used
C programming language
GCC compiler (or any C compiler)
